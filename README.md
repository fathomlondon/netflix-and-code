_This is the Fathom coding test for prospective UI Developers_

# Netflix and Code

We want you to build a simple webpage that shows the hidden categories on Netflix, giving users the ability to search for a genre or category and then see the results.
 
You can find a list of the hidden categories here: <http://whatsonnetflix.com/netflix-hacks/the-netflix-id-bible-every-category-on-netflix/>
 
You can deep link to a category on Netflix like so: <http://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/INSERTNUMBER>
 
The objectives are as follows:
 
1. Devise a way to *programatically* get the content from the above blog link, and store it in a format that can be utilized by your frontend code. The page doesn't update often, so you shouldn't be concerned about storing stale data / keeping it fresh.
2. Build a UI that meets the criteria of functionality and looks pleasing. The app should do the following:
    1. List out all the Netflix categories.
    2. Click a category and it launches Netflix in a new window, deep linking to the category.
    3. A user should be able to type in a search box and see the results filter immediately below.
    4. A user should be able to navigate the interface via the keyboard.
 
## Rules

1. Don’t use any CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see your hand written abilities.
2. Don’t use any frameworks, we want to see pure JS (ES2015 is encouraged).


## Submitting your code

Please host your code on a GitHub repository and provide us with a link to view the work.
_Bonus points_ if you deploy it to a static hosting service for us to view.
